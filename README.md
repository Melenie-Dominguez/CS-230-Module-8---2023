#Summarize the project and what it was solving 

The clients for Gaming Room wanted to create a web-based application that was based on a Televison game called Win, Lose or draw. Which was from the 1980â€™s and the game show had puzzles and drawing games to guess certain clues. The software requirements that allowed users/players to be involved. Such as uploading pictures and answering questions that the games would ask them.  
  

#What did you do particularly well? 
  
Something that I think I did well in the process of developing this documentation was taking into consideration what the client really desired to have in the game. Having meetings and discussing what they were interested in seeing in the games and application set up. 
  

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure etc? 

If I had to choose one part of my work from these documents to revise it would be having a better understanding of the operating system. Since it is a huge part of the project, I would put more of my focus on that to make sure that there are not any complications for when the users/players are using it. It is very important to take time to think in the users/players point of view.
  

#Did you find writting any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to support your network? 

I feel that I had to face some challenges while creating this project then I did with other projects I have done, what helped me overcome this was by practicing and revising my work to correct the areas I had mistakes on. I also needed to have a lot of patience to do this as well. As well as making sure that I added and did everything that the client wanted for the application while I also had to think in the users/players point of view to ensure that it was fun and not to complex to use.  

What skills from this project will be particulary transferable to other projects and/or course work? 

I feel that I learned a lot while creating this project, I learned that I needed to be more patience. Which means that I would have to plan ahead and schedule enough time to work on the tasks that I had to do for the project. I learned new and different ways to create a application that made me think of different wasy to make sure that everyone would be satified with the outcome of the game, not just the client/owner. Which is something I will defenitly be doing from now on in future projects.
